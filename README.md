A dynamic border for Melty Blood Actress Again: Current Code!
Forked from Kikasuru's version and modified to display steam version sidebars instead.

## Dependencies
 - [Python 3.6.x or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-396/) (3.9.6 is highly recommended.)
 - [flask](https://pypi.org/project/flask/)

## Installation
Simply install the dependencies and run `__init__.py` included in the `melty_streaming` folder.

## Running
The website will be hosted at ``127.0.0.1:5000``, open that in your browser or create a "Browser Source" in your OBS software.

## Special Thanks
Thank you to [@shiburizu](https://github.com/shiburizu) for several aspects of grabbing the Melty Blood process and helping me out with a few things.
